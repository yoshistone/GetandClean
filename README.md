## run_analysis.R
*  This script merges the training and test sets to create one set.
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set while appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
*  From the data set in the previous step, it creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
